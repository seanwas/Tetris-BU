### Tetris

## Project Description:
Clone of the popular handheld game. Tetris is a challenging game in which a random pice will be added to your screen and you must use the keys to rotate the piece and move it left to right to place it in the correct spot. Place the pieces i the right and the create a row and the entire row will disappear and you will receive bonus points. 

Keep the rows low because as the levels increase, so does the speed. So you will need as much room as you can when they start coming at you. Complete 20 levels and you will win
